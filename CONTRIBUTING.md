## We respect and appreciate different kinds of contributions

Ways that you can contribute:

### Community governance experts

We value collaboration with contributors who bring their experience with code of conduct design or enforcement to continue to improve Contributor Covenant.

### Writers and copy editors

We welcome contributions to improve the language of our site.

### Designers

We welcome improvements to the design elements of our website or other ways that you can use your talents to improve [contributor-covenant.org](https://contributor-covenant.org).

### Translators and native speakers

We're always looking for translations by native speakers are thankful to the dozens of volunteer translators and reviewers who have donated their time and expertise.

If you are a native speaker interested in doing a translation, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository and make a branch for your translation.
1. If it's a new language, add it to `config.toml`, with a localized name and language code/optional region (e.g. `pt` or `pt-br`).
1. Create a markdown file with your translation in `version/3/0/code_of_conduct.LANGUAGECODE.md`. (Underscores, not hyphens.) Use the English markdown file as an example.
1. Update the two fields at the top of your new markdown file: `reportingPlaceholder`, which should contain the exact placeholder text in the "how to report" section, and `enforcementPlaceholder`, which should contain the exact placeholder text in the "Addressing and Repairing Harm" section.
1. Open a pull request.
1. We will put out a call to have one or more other native speakers review the translation.
1. Collaborate until the translation is satisfactory.
1. We will merge your translation!
1. HTML and plain text versions are automatically generated from your markdown file.
1. A link to your translation is automatically added to the translations page.

Note that we will not accept machine translations.
